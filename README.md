# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
Step1 : import the numpy module to use the built in function for calculation
Step 2: prepare the list from linear equation and assign in np.array
Step 3: import lu and use lu_factor,lu_solve to solve the matrix
Step 4: end the program

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
